# BLB Jumpstart Helper

This rough script was thrown together to help analyze drafting strategies for [Bloomburrow Jumpstart](https://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/bloomburrow-jumpstart). Its approach is _specific_ to Bloomburrow's highly typal design, but it could be adapted to other highly typal cubes or those with very clearly defined colour-associated mechanics.

No external dependencies are required to run this script; only standard python library modules were used.
